# Communal Cookbook

The project's purpose is to act as a digital recipe book, for the useage of a relatively small user-base and myself to share recipes in an easily accesible and readable format.
This is to act as an alternative to clumsily sharing photos of the recipes or links to other sites that may not be accessible in different countries.
